1. Descriptive Statistics (Panchayat-wise)

    Objective: Summarize and describe key characteristics of the dataset.
    Methods:
        Frequency & Percentage Distributions (for categorical variables like gender of informant, having KWA connection, primary water source types, daily water consumption, primary usage, daily water usage source, agricultural water source, having isues with water supply, frequency of supply issues, check by authority, satisfaction with water taste, satisfaction with water smell, pH value, noticeable contamination, contamination explanation, septic tank or wastewater presence nearby primary water source, pipeline water chlorinated belief, frequency_of_cleaning_water_tank, water_purifying_techniques, types_of_water_purifications, Waterborne_Diseases_Last_Year, Confidence_in_Safety, noticed_any_changes_in_health_after_using_current_drinking_water, types_of_health_issue, willingness_to_pay_for_better_drinking_water_services, Household_Members_below_1year_old, Household_Members_below_1year_to_3years_old, Household_Members_below_4years_to_8years_old, Household_Members_below_9years_to_12years_old, Household_Members_below_13years_and_above, Educational_Qualification, Occupation_of_informant, Primary_Income_Earner_Qualification, Primary_Income_Earner_Occupation, Monthly_Household_Income)
        Frequency & Percentage Distributions
        Mean, Median, Mode (for numerical variables like pH values, household income)
        Standard Deviation & Variance (for variability in pH, daily water consumption, etc.)
        Cross-tabulations (e.g., comparing water source distribution across panchayats)
        
        
2. Inferential Statistics

    Objective: Make predictions or generalizations from sample data.
    Methods:
        Chi-Square Test (To test associations between categorical variables)
            Example: Is there a significant relationship between "Primary Water Source" and "Waterborne Diseases"?
        T-Test or ANOVA (To compare means of numerical variables across groups)
            Example: Does the pH level significantly differ between different water sources?
        Correlation Analysis (Pearson/Spearman/Kendall) (To check relationships between two numerical variables)
            Example: Does household income influence willingness to pay for better water services?
        Regression Analysis (Linear/Logistic)
            Linear Regression: Predicting pH values based on water source types.
            Logistic Regression: Predicting likelihood of contamination presence based on demographics.

3. Spatial and Temporal Analysis

    Objective: Identify trends across locations and time.
    Methods:
        Geospatial Mapping (If GPS coordinates are available)
            Example: Mapping water contamination hotspots across districts.
        Time Series Analysis (If data spans multiple time periods)
            Example: Changes in frequency of waterborne diseases over time.
        Cluster Analysis (K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering) to group locations with similar water quality issues.

4. Multivariate Analysis

    Objective: Analyze interactions between multiple variables simultaneously.
    Methods:
        Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (To reduce dimensionality and find key variables contributing to variance)
        Factor Analysis (To identify latent factors affecting water quality)
        Multivariate Regression (To model how multiple factors together impact waterborne diseases)

5. Hypothesis Testing & Statistical Significance

    Objective: Verify if observed differences or relationships are statistically significant.
    Methods:
        Z-Test or T-Test (Comparing two groups, e.g., pH levels of well vs. river water)
        ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) (Comparing multiple groups, e.g., daily water consumption across different income levels)
        Chi-Square Test for Independence (Checking if contamination presence is related to district location)

6. Data Visualization

    Objective: Represent insights visually for better understanding.
    Techniques:
        Bar Charts & Pie Charts (Categorical distributions, e.g., water sources)
        Histograms & Box Plots (Numerical distributions, e.g., pH values)
        Heatmaps (Correlation among numerical values like pH and contamination)
        Scatter Plots (Relationships, e.g., water supply issues vs. diseases)
        Maps (If spatial data is available, e.g., mapping contamination levels)

7. Machine Learning (Advanced Prediction & Classification)

    Objective: Predict water contamination risk or classify household behaviors.
    Methods:
        Decision Trees & Random Forests (To classify risk levels of contamination based on multiple factors)
        Support Vector Machines (SVM) (For classification tasks like high vs. low willingness to pay)
        Neural Networks & Deep Learning (For complex relationships between multiple water quality indicators)

Possible Research Questions for Scientific Deduction

✔️ Does water source type significantly affect the prevalence of waterborne diseases? (Chi-square, logistic regression)
✔️ Are there significant differences in pH levels across different sources? (ANOVA, t-test)
✔️ What factors most influence the willingness to pay for better water services? (Regression analysis, machine learning)
✔️ Which districts report the highest frequency of contamination, and why? (Geospatial & cluster analysis)
✔️ Does household income correlate with access to cleaner water sources? (Pearson correlation)
